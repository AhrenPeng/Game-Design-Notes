# Common Frameworks for Ludology

- MDA: mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics.

  - **Mechanics:** The particular components of the game at the level of data representation  and algorithms 
  - **Dynamics:** The runtime behaviour of the mechanics acting on player inputs and each other's outputs over time
  - **Aesthetics:** The desirable emotional responses evoked in the player when she interacts with the game system

- Formal, Dramatic, Dynamic Elements.

  - **Formal elements:** The elements that make games different from other forms of media interaction and provide the structure of a game.Formal elements include things like rules, resources, and boundaries .

    1. **Player interaction pattern:**  How do the players interact?

    2. **Objectives:** What are the players trying to achieve in the game?

    3. **Rules:** Rules limit the players' actions by telling them what they may and may not do in the game.

    4. **Procedures:** The types of actions taken by the players in the game. 

    5. **Resources:** Resources are elements that have value in the game.

    6. **Boundaries:** Where does the game end and reality begin?

    7. **Outcome:** How did the game end?

  - **Dramatic elements:** The story and narrative of the game, including the premise. Dramatic elements tie the game together, help players understand the rules, and encourage the player to become emotionally invested in the outcome of the game.

    1. **Premise:** The basic story of the game world.
    2. **Character:** Characters are the individuals around whom the story revolves.
    3. **Story:** The plot of the game.

  - **Dynamic elements:** The game in motion. After players turn the rules into actual gameplay, the game has moved into dynamic elements. Dynamic elements include things like strategy, behaviour, and relationships between game entities. It is important to note that this is related to the use of the term *dynamics* in MDA but is broader because it includes more than just the runtime behaviour of the mechanics.

    1. **Emergence:** Collisions of seemingly simple rules can lead to unpredictable outcomes.
    2. **Emergent narrative:** In addition to the dynamic behaviour of mechanics covered in the MDA model.
    3. **Playtesting is the only way to understand dynamics:** Experienced game designers can often make better predictions about dynamic behaviour and emergence than novice designers, but no one understands exactly how the dynamics of a game will play out without playtesting them.

- Elemental Tetrad.

  - **Mechanics:** The rules for interaction between the player and the game.
  - **Aesthetics:** Aesthetics describe how the game is perceived by the five senses: vision, sound, smell, taste, and touch.
  - **Technology:** This element covers all the underlying technology that makes the game work.
  - **Story:** The narrative  that occurs in your game and includes both premise and characters as well.
