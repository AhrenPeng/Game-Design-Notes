### Tracy Fullertion
-  A closed, formal system that engages players in a structured conflict and resolves its uncertainty in an unequal outcome.
	-  **Formal elements:** The elements that differentiate a game from other types of media: rules, procedures, resources, objectives, boundaries, conflict, and outcome.
	-  **(Dynamic) systems:** Methods of interaction that evolve as the game is played.
	-  **Conflict structure:** The ways in which players interact with each other.
	-  **Uncertainty:** The interaction between randomness, determinism, and player stratrgy.
	-  **Unequal outcome:** How does the game end? Do players win, lose, or something else?
